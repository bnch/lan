# lan

Lan is a basic fully-fledged osu! private server prototype designed for playing osu! in the local network.

## Running

Lan should work on just about anything Redis runs on. All the information that
is required to run Lan is stored on Redis (don't worry, it's not that much). In
most cases, if you have redis, you can just grab a build artifact from
[here](http://zxq.co:60291/view/bnch/lan), generate a self signed certificate
and get a webserver running TODO
